              KnowMo (Know More) started as a late-night idea that turned into a platform for students like us—those who may not love taking notes in class but always find themselves searching for study material at the last minute.            </p>

                KnowMo is a community-driven learning platform built for Chitkara University students. It provides a single place to discover and share notes, study materials, guides, and resources contributed by students who have already walked the same academic path.
              </p>
              <p>
                While many existing platforms serve only a specific department or audience, KnowMo is designed for the entire university—bringing students together through collaboration, shared knowledge, and a commitment to helping one another succeed.

                If you also faced issues while preparing for your upcoming STs or
                End-Terms, you may know the struggle of finding content from toppers and
                asking them to share it.
              </p>

              <p>
                Now you know the problem, and it would be great if you shared your
                resources.
